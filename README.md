# LockNote 🔒 🗒️ - A Secure Note-Taking App

In an era where data breaches and cyber threats are increasingly common, LockNote provides a secure and efficient way to store and manage sensitive information. This project is a full-stack web application designed to offer encrypted note-taking capabilities, ensuring that users' private data remains confidential.

By leveraging modern authentication methods, encryption techniques, and a robust backend architecture, LockNote serves as a practical cybersecurity-focused tool for individuals and organisations seeking to enhance their data security.

With an emphasis on privacy, security, and user experience, LockNote integrates **FastAPI** for a high-performance backend and **Next.js** with **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS** for a sleek, modern frontend.

This project not only showcases best practices in secure web development but also serves as an educational resource for those interested in cybersecurity, encryption, and secure application design.
